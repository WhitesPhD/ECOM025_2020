## Financial Econometrics (Course material)

This material covers some of the topics I covered in my Financial Econometrics course (MSc in Finance and Econometrics) at the Queen Mary, University of London. 

The syllabus contains:

* Random variables and expectations
* Estimation, inference and hypothesis testing
* Regression analysis
* Univariate time series analysis
* Univariate volatility modeling
* Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall
* Multivariate volatility modeling and correlations

The material include slides and some Matlab codes for the tutorials.

Hope you will find this useful
