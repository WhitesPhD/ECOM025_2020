## Financial Econometrics (Course material)

This is some of the material I covered last year for my course of "Financial Econometrics" at the Queen Mary, University of London. Topics are the following:

The syllabus contains:

* Random variables and expectations
* Estimation, inference and hypothesis testing
* Regression analysis
* Univariate time series analysis
* Univariate volatility modeling
* Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall
* Multivariate volatility modeling and correlations

The material include slides and some Matlab codes for the tutorials. This is material for a graduate level module, so an undergraduate degree is useful. 

Hope you will find this useful
